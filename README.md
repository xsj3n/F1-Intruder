### What is this?

F1-Intruder is- to put it bluntly- a Burpsuite Intruder clone. This is for 
everyone who would like to use the burp suite intruder tool within the 
community edition, but without the throttling. 

It does have it's differences, but it is designed to largely be the same. Even a
Burpsuite plugin to send a http request that is in burp, directly to the F1-Intruder.
